## Moving In:

OK, we've filled this box with stuff we've scavanged from this inventr.io facility.  But there's a lot more useful stuff here that's just too large to move or would be damaged by removing it, like the solar panels on the roof.

What do you think of moving to this place?  It's not likely to draw many other scavengers, should be defensible and with the solar panels on the roof we'll have power.  We can even grow our own food on the roof.  This building is also large enough that we could allow other survivors to join us and help us defend and build up this place.

You like the idea?  Great.  Let's go move whatever we can use from your house and start setting this place up!
